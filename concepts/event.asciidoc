[[concepts-event-concepts]]
=== Concepts

WonderPush enables you to track business events that make sense for your
application, and use them to further <<concepts-audience,segment your
audience>> using behavioral patterns.

An event is attached to an <<concepts-installation,installation>>, itself
attached to a <<concepts-user,user>>. This way, you can notify a user on
the right device at the right moment.

The event object can host custom data for your private use. It can be
structured or mere key-value pairs, and they can be indexed and reused
to build <<concepts-audience,audience segments>>.

Look at the API reference of the SDK for the platform of your choice

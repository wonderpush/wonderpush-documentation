[[concepts-user-concepts]]
=== Concepts

Each user of your application has its own object representation in
WonderPush. A user is identified by an id that you provide. You are
encouraged to use the same id that you use in your service. This id
should be unique by application.

A user may use multiple devices and a device may be used by multiple
users, all without interference. A notification won't be shown on a
device if another user has logged in in-between.

The user object can host custom data for your private use. It can be
structured or mere key-value pairs, and they can be indexed and reused
to build <<concepts-audience,audience segments>>.

Look at the API reference of the SDK for the platform of your choice
for more information.

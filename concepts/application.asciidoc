=== Concepts

In order to start integrating WonderPush in your own application,
you must first register it in your dashboard.

An application comes with its own isolated database, storing
<<concepts-user,users>>, <<concepts-installation,installations>> and
<<concepts-event,events>>, but also the
<<concepts-audience,audience segments>>
and <<concepts-notifications,notifications>> you create.

=== Concepts

The audience represents the entire population of users who installed
your application that are registered in WonderPush.

The entire audience may not be reachable by push notifications as
we respect opt-in/opt-out choices of the users, which are enforced
by the system on some platforms.

Using the SDK, you can easily tag and track meaningful events performed
by the user directly from your application. This enables you to perform
powerful segmentation of your audience. Such parts of the audience are
called _segments_. WonderPush permits you to define numerous segments.

Segments are used as the target for your <<concepts-notifications,notifications>>.

==== Create a segment

Creating a segment in WonderPush is easy:

* Select _Audience_ in the left menu of your https://dashboard.wonderpush.com/["dashboard"].
* Click the _Create segment_ button on the right.
* Name the segment you wish to create. +
  WonderPush will use this name in diverse places of the interface.
  A good name describing the audience segment is important to always
  remember precisely what group of users is covered by the segment. +
  You can always edit this name afterwards.
* Click the _Add criteria_ button to start selecting users of interest.
* The interface will intuitively make you build phrases that describe
  your criteria:
** The first selector proposes multiple kind of criteria to choose from.
** The other fields adapt to the chosen kind and the second selector
   lets you choose an operator to apply.
** The third field expects for a value to complete the criterion.
* Add as many criterion as needed to nail down the audience to the
  precise segment you wish. +
  When multiple criteria exist, you can choose whether a user should
  either match _all_ of the criteria, or if it has to match _any_ of
  them.
* As you edit the rules defining the segment, you can see a preview
  of the matching users in the list below the editor. +
  The number of matching users is especially important when using the
  segment as a target for a <<concepts-notifications,notification>>.
* Once happy with the result, hit _Save_.
